You will be prompted with a text input labeled <em>"Account."</em> You can enter the name of a business here to search for existing accounts in the Salesforce database, which will show up on the left hand column, or click <b>New</b> on the top left to create a new account.
				p.

				p.
					All inputs can be cycled through by clicking the <b><</b> and <b>></b> buttons, or by pressing the <em>left</em> and <em>right</em> keys. Press <em>space</em> to focus on the input if you want to type in a value manually, and press <em>enter</em> to enter any data and cycle to the next field.
				p.
					Once you have created or selected an account, you can create contacts for it by either cycling past all the account fields or pressing <em>down</em>. The <em>down</em> and <em>up</em> arrows will cycle between contacts, listed on the left-hand side. These can be selected by the mouse as well.
				p.
					New contacts will not be created until you click <b>Save All</b>, nor will any changes made to an existing account or any existing contacts. <b>Refresh</b> will reset all fields and contacts to the values on Salesforce, thereby erasing any unsaved changes.
